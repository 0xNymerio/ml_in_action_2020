@VirginAmerica and it's a really big bad thing about it
@VirginAmerica seriously would pay $30 a flight for seats that didn't have this playing.it's really the only bad thing about flying VA
@VirginAmerica SFO-PDX schedule is still MIA.
@VirginAmerica  I flew from NYC to SFO last week and couldn't fully sit in my seat due to two large gentleman on either side of me. HELP!
@VirginAmerica why are your first fares in May over three times more than other carriers when all seats are available to select???
@VirginAmerica you guys messed up my seating.. I reserved seating with my friends and you guys gave my seat away ... üò° I want free internet

"@VirginAmerica Hi, Virgin! I'm on hold for 40-50 minutes -- are there any earlier flights from LA to NYC tonight; earlier than 11:50pm?"
@VirginAmerica everything was fine until you lost my bag
@VirginAmerica your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors? http://t.co/hy0VrfhjHt
@VirginAmerica what is going on with customer service? Is there anyway to speak to a human asap? Thank you.
@VirginAmerica why can't you supp the biz traveler like @SouthwestAir  and have customer service like @JetBlue #neverflyvirginforbusiness
@VirginAmerica you're the best!! Whenever I (begrudgingly) use any other airline I'm delayed and Late Flight :(
@VirginAmerica I have no interesting flying with you after this. I will Cancelled Flight my next four flights I planned.#neverflyvirginforbusiness
@VirginAmerica it was a disappointing experience which will be shared with every business traveler I meet. #neverflyvirgin
@VirginAmerica I‚Äôm having trouble adding this flight my wife booked to my Elevate account. Help? http://t.co/pX8hQOKS3R
@VirginAmerica Why is the site down?  When will it be back up?
@VirginAmerica I like the TV and interesting video . Just disappointed in Cancelled Flightled flight when other flights went out to jfk on Saturday .
"@VirginAmerica just landed in LAX, an hour after I should of been here. Your no Late Flight bag check is not business travel friendly #nomorevirgin"
"@VirginAmerica Is it me, or is your website down?  BTW, your new website isn't a great user experience.  Time for another redesign."
@VirginAmerica I can't check in or add a bag. Your website isn't working. I've tried both desktop and mobile http://t.co/AvyqdMpi1Y
@VirginAmerica - Let 2 scanned in passengers leave the plane than told someone to remove their bag from 1st class bin? #uncomfortable
@virginamerica What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
@VirginAmerica is anyone doing anything there today?  Website is useless and no one is answering the phone.
@VirginAmerica why must a traveler miss a flight to Late Flight check a bag?  I missed my morning appointments and you lost my business. #sfo2lax
@virginamerica how's a direct flight FLL-&gt
@VirginAmerica your no Late Flight bag check just lost you my business. I missed flight and AM apt. Three other people on flight had same exp.
@VirginAmerica called your service line and was hung up on. This is awesome. #sarcasm
@VirginAmerica your site is tripping. I'm trying to check in and I'm getting the plain text version. I am reluctant to enter any card info.
"@VirginAmerica should I be concerned that I am about to fly on a plane that needs to be delayed due to a ""tech stop""?"
@VirginAmerica Use another browser! 2015 &amp
"@VirginAmerica And now the flight Flight Booking Problems site is totally down. Folks, what is the problem?"
@VirginAmerica I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
@VirginAmerica i need to change my flight thats scheduled in 9 hours and 120 min wait time on phone. Im calling intern. Help!!
@VirginAmerica you are failing your customers because your check in process does not link to TSA pre-check.
@VirginAmerica @FiDiFamilies us too! Terrible airline! Just gave us a hotel hotline number and said sorry
@VirginAmerica @ChrysiChrysic your assistance yesterday when u Cancelled Flightled our flight was to give us a hotel hotline  Shame on you!
@VirginAmerica Another delayed flight? #likingyoulessandless
@VirginAmerica I need to register a service dog for a first class ticket from SFO &gt
@VirginAmerica why can't we book seats on your flights when we buy them or even during check in? Creates so much anxiety! #frustrated
@VirginAmerica You'd think paying an extra $100 bucks RT for luggage might afford you hiring an extra hand at @sfo #lame
@VirginAmerica please provide status for flight 769.  I cant imagine it's on time as the Web indicates  dude to weather here and/or Dallas
"@VirginAmerica I paid the premium to fly you across the country, you Cancelled Flight my flight and offer no check fee or upgrade love? Sad face :("
@VirginAmerica question: is it not possible to book a seat for an infant under 2? It's not giving me the option but we want a seat for him.
.@VirginAmerica I don't understand why you need a DM to give me an answer on if you have a damaged luggage policy.
.@VirginAmerica does that mean you don't have a policy for destroyed luggage?
@VirginAmerica having problems Flight Booking Problems on the web site. keeps giving me an error and to contact by phone.  phone is 30 minute wait.
@VirginAmerica How do I reschedule my Cancelled Flightled flights online? The change button is greyed out!
"@VirginAmerica I rang, but there is a wait for 35 minutes!! I can book the same ticket through a vendor, fix your site"
"@VirginAmerica got a flight (we were told) for 4:50 today..,checked my email and its for 4;50 TOMORROW. This is unacceptable."
"@VirginAmerica our flight into lga was Cancelled Flighted. We're stuck in Dallas. I called to reschedule, told I could get a flight for today...(1/2)"
@virginamerica why don't any of the pairings include red wine?! Only white is offered :( #redwineisbetter

@VirginAmerica - Your site seems a little wonked right now. May want to have a look. Tried on two browsers. No CSS? http://t.co/8qsQMM7KF2
@VirginAmerica I'm disappointed that the agent at the designated silver status check in line @Dulles_Airport closed to assist all pasengers
@VirginAmerica Is it normal to receive no reply from Central Baggage #baggageissues #smh

"@VirginAmerica congrats, you just got all my business from EWR to SFO/LAX. Fuck you @united fl1289 SFO/EWR was the clincher..."
@VirginAmerica  I applied over 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard back and I'm flying this week #disappointed
@VirginAmerica - too many apologies! You r the worse airlines! Don't even respond to your cudtomers
@VirginAmerica shame on VA for making people spend money in stranded cities when other airlines are landing at JFK! Who will reimburse me?
@VirginAmerica too bad you say it takes 10 to 14 days via YOUR confirmation email. When I inquired after 3 weeks you claim 6 to 8 weeks!
@VirginAmerica Flight from BOS &gt
"@VirginAmerica a lot of ""apologies"" being thrown out to customers from what I can see.Very sad. Thanks for nothing. Worst airline ever."

@VirginAmerica You guys charged me $100 to reschedule a flight that was then Cancelled Flighted and are now refusing to refund it. What's the deal?
@VirginAmerica can‚Äôt access your website from Safari on iPhone 6. Seems to work on Mac and iPad. Need iPhone to add Passbook.
"@VirginAmerica your mobile site is broken, shows""{{header.elevateUser.numOfPointsAvailable || '0' | number}} Points"", won't let me checkin"
